We often say that the sun rises,  
but on the moon, one would see the 'Earth rise.'  
When the frame of reference changes,  
what seems natural becomes astonishing.  
In the vast expanse of space and time,  
our beliefs and assumptions are merely part of a larger plan.  
As the stars shift and the heavens turn,  
certainty is a fragile thing,  
bound by the limits of our perception and time.  
The truths we choose to believe in  
often dissipate like mist.  
In the quiet of the night, we are often struck by the thought  
that perhaps what we call truth  
is merely a rough draft in the Creator's hands.
