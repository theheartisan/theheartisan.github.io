The so-called “I” is the sum of all past experiences—composed of the people I have met, the things I have touched, the love I have felt, and the pain I have lost myself in. All of these together form the “me” of this moment; take away even one slight of me, and I am no longer the same. Hermann Hesse’s spiritual journey of self-discovery, as portrayed in Siddhartha and other works, reflects this notion of the self as an evolving entity shaped by life’s myriad experiences. After reading these words, perhaps you will view the people you have encountered in a slightly different light—recognizing that, they together with you shape the uniqueness of you.
